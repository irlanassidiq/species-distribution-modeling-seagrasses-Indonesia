# species-distribution-modeling-seagrasses-Indonesia

# In this project, 2 types of datas are required (Occurrences and Predictors)

# Occurrences data contained coordinates (longitude and latitude) based on field observation and combined with cloud platform (GBIF, OBIS and metadata (JaLTER))

# Predictors is a raster data contain value of each parameters in a raster cell, this project used the data stored in Bio-ORACLE (bio-oracle.org), which possessed the capacity to forecast as well

# Step 1 (occurrences.r)
#compiling ocurrences data into one csv files

# Step 2 (predictors.r)
#In this step, raster data that have been obtained from Bio-ORACLE need to be adjusted into study area (Indonesia)
#Next step including masking the predictor rasters with up to 60 meters depth (no seagrass can be found beyond that!)
#Correlation test then performed to avoid collinearity between predictors

# Step 3 (thinning.r)
#Data cleaning is required to avoid model overfitting
#In this project  thinning is performed as a way to clean ocurrences data
#Because our predictors raster cell size is 9.2 km sq, there must not be more than one ocurrence in one cell
#This method really powerful when cleaning condensed ocurrences

# Step 4 (sdm maxent.r)
#Prior on modeling, creating pseudo-absences is needed, because our data contained Presence-only data, the model need to be train with absences data
#Algorithm used is MaxEnt, Maximum Entropy for long. Is using similar method like Random Forest
#AUC need to be checked after the computer done its work, if AUC > 0.8, the model is powerful enough to perform future projection
#The modeling is executed with 10 bootstrapping which is the ensembled into one output

# The end product gave us an insight on species site suitability
